CS225 Final Project

Must load one or more data files as a graph and be able to use that graph to run algorithms of interest to the data set. 

Your code must work on your chosen data set and on other data that is of the correct format to match the data set you are working on.

You should have tests for each of your algorithms with appropriate test cases. These should be similar to the tests we provide on labs or mps.

Your code must build and run on EWS using only the material in your repo and libraries publicly installed on EWS. 

All instructions needed to build the project must be in your repo and easy to understand.

Algorithms:
Usene of the Traversals we covered in class and be able to output that result. It must also handle two other options one of which must be from the complex or uncovered options listed below.

Traversals:
BFS (Breadth First Search)
DFS (Depth First Search)

Covered Algorithms:
Shortest Path:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Minimum Spanning Tree:
Kruskal Algorithm
Prim’s Algorithm

Complex or Uncovered Options:
A* Search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
Iterative deepening depth-first search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search)
Delta-stepping SSSP (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196677403000762)
