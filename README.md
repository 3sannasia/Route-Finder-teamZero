"The README clearly and succintly describes the following:

The linkage and location of all major code, data, results, and deliverable files.

The necessary commands to run the assignment are well described and include instructions for selecting the input dataset and output location

The test suite is well described and instructions on how to reproduce the tests are provided."

A descriptive README. In addition to the code itself, you must include a human-readable README.md which describes:

Github Organization – You should describe the physical location of all major files and deliverables (code, tests, data, the written report, the presentation video, etc…)

Running Instructions – You should provide full instructions on how to build and run your executable, including how to define the input data and output location for each method. You should also have instructions on how to build and run your test suite, including a general description on what tests you have created. It is in your best interest to make the instructions (and the running of your executables and tests) as simple and straightforward as possible.\
